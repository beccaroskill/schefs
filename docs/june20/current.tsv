She shares her feelings of suspicion, recognition, anger, depression, and ultimately forgiveness. Since then I've wondered what it means when we say we forgive someone whether that's a friend, partner, family member or just ourselves. In this experience we'll be discussing what forgiveness means, how we exercise it, who deserves it and whether forgiving really means forgetting. If nothing else let's talk about the masterpiece that is Lemonade.

Ethan	Pan	Brown University	ethan_pan@brown.edu	Lunch	3 PM	Rice: Feeding Asian America	One of the most unifying experiences for the Asian American community is eating rice. From basmati to jasmine, the short and sticky to the long and delicate, we all have our own type of rice and the stories to go along with it. In the first half, we will all share a thought about rice: why scorched rice is the ultimate snack food, that time you forgot to cook the rice before mom came home, or just your favorite way to eat rice (desserts! noodles! alcohol?). Then, we will broaden our conversation to Asian food in college. How has your experience been with the food in dining halls? Do you miss the food back at home? Can you find adequate substitutes? How has quarantine made this better or worse? This is a time to think and talk about food and the Asian American identity.	Bring any form of rice you can find!

In March, music companies like Moog, Korg, and Ableton released production software for free or lowered rates in the hope of inspiring musicians staying at home. Now it’s June, and I’m still not any closer to having an ambient house project. What kind of challenges to making music have arisen during the pandemic? Does new gear really “up your game” or does it end up being just another instrument? How can we stay enthusiastic about music while remaining socially distant?   The venues are likely to remain closed for a while, so it’s important that we share ways to stay creative and get inspired. Let’s gather and discuss our personal approaches to making music at home!

Samantha	Sacks	Columbia University	ss5380@columbia.edu	Snack	5PM	art and the political	For German philosopher Theodor Adorno, the discussion of the role of artistic creation in a political society was not resolved by French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre’s 1948 book What is Literature?  This disagreement between thinkers falls along the lines of whether “committed” or “autonomous” art best realizes art’s important function as social commentary. Committed art refers to that which is directly political, and autonomous art to that which is supposedly apolitical and avant-garde.   Is it possible to create art that is autonomous from society? Is it the responsibility of art to transcend our corporeal experiences? Is political art pandering? Can any art BE apolitical? Does art = freedom??  NO formal knowledge of the topic is necessary!

Samuel	Needleman	Columbia	sn2695@columbia.edu	Brunch	12:30 p.m.	Food for Thought	Join us for an exegesis, by turns earnest and exuberant, of the egg. We'll start by scrambling or frying or poaching or soft-boiling or shirring—whatever your heart desires. Then, while indulging, we'll discuss: What's in an egg? There's the egg in art history, from Velázquez to Dalí to Koons. The egg is ubiquitous in contemporary architecture, a landmark from London to Albany to Mumbai. And, of course, there's egg as moral metaphor (think "bad egg"). Let's explore this fertile ground together.	Please bring eggs.

John	Forbes	UC Berkeley	john_forbes@berkeley.edu	Tea	12PM	Walking on Eggshells	The world is a crazy place right now. The goal of this conversation is to put curious minds together to discuss the plethora of society shaking events that have occurred within the past few months. From the BLM movement to COVID; foreign policy regarding Hong Kong to the role of the Information Age/social media in it all. If you’re the type of person who likes to dig into worldly events objectively and with philosophical rigor - this SCHEFS session is for you! In a respectful way, I hope we can leave our biases at the door and dig deep into the problems we’re entering society as adults with. Come with diverse perspectives, anecdotes, and the love of learning & debate!	Be well read on the mentioned political events, and any other major event you’d like to discuss :)	Tuesday, June 16	https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/be2907657944667fa363a14137ae3ae874034c8dfa1f2bd567ecd85aac4ef991/3C399E8A_166C_49F5_A8F6_4A2AF441BECA.jpeg	2023	Data Science & Energy & Resources	I’m a rising sophomore at UC Berkeley passionate about climate change, entrepreneurship, and philosophy!		https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/49d39265d2216a39554ab683343c14d22d544e9f1cd3f3ffa50d254c7cd72081/2710408F_F254_49E6_B34F_95E0E867A57C.jpeg		6/2/2020 21:32:07	ylsauya04gpu1068corylsau9pe3nhe0
Katie	DeVries	Columbia University	ktd2122@columbia.edu	Lunch	3pm	Dungeons and Dragons: Lost in Space	Tired of being trapped in the house? Here’s your chance to escape!  The USS Star Fleet is recruiting  commanding officers, technicians, medics, scientists and explorers to join a dangerous but critical mission. Your job: to rescue alien creatures in distress, discover new worlds, and most importantly: to survive!  Dungeons and Dragons is a choose your own adventure game - but on a new level. Your creativity is your best weapon - you can execute any action you can think of, as long as you roll the dice high enough. There is no predetermined ending, no fate.  You are truly in charge of your own destiny. As Nietzsche said, “nothing is true, everything is permitted”!!   Escape your dungeon and explore the universe 🛸🚀	Try to craft in your imagination what your character will be like. What’s their job onboard? What are their intentions (glory, adventure, treasure)? Look up the D&D alignment chart - where do you land?

That effectively means I’ll start the story and craft the parts of the universe we’ll discover. I’ll also make some decisions based on the rolling of dice and the general progression of the story to keep things interesting:) Outside of D&D, I’m a fan of Outer Space, chiefing and chefing, and Kanye West! From the Bay, go warriors.		https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/f7af51e1b909b5ff7547f7b389f457a6f46ef981fe3e15cf414549a20606e476/BC9134B5_7CB2_42D7_BBE0_AABF02EB965B.jpeg		6/3/2020 2:39:14	o68ac9e94y4mo6q8d0vw257jwk3qiq8z
